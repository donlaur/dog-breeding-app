# Dog Breeding App

This project is a web application for managing dog records within a breeding program. It allows users to create, update, view, and delete dog records, as well as upload cover photos to Supabase Storage.

## Project Structure

- **client/**: Contains the React front-end code.
- **server/**: Contains the Flask API (including `routes.py`).
- **.env**: Environment variables for Supabase credentials.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Key Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete dog records.
- **File Uploads**: Cover photos are uploaded to Supabase Storage with unique filenames.
- **Graceful Error Handling**: 
  - Numeric fields are parsed silently; invalid or empty inputs are converted to `NULL` to avoid database errors.
  - API responses are checked using `.dict()` to extract errors without exposing internal details to end users.
- **Optional Parent Fields**: Sire and dam fields are optional and can be left blank.

## Design Decisions

- **Silent Numeric Parsing**:
  - Helper functions (e.g., `parse_int_field_silent`) convert empty strings or invalid values to `None`.
  - This prevents errors like "invalid input syntax for type bigint: ''" in the database.
- **File Uploads**:
  - Files are temporarily saved using Pythonâ€™s `tempfile` module and uploaded with a unique filename (using UUID) to prevent collisions.
  - Temporary files are cleaned up immediately after upload.
- **API Response Handling**:
  - The Supabase Python client returns an `APIResponse` object. We use `.dict()` to extract error and data information.
- **Comments and Documentation**:
  - Inline comments and docstrings are used throughout the code to explain the purpose and reasoning of each section.
  - This documentation aids future developers and helps AI models maintain and update the code without regression bugs.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dog-breeding-app.git
   cd dog-breeding-app
Set Up the Server:

Create a virtual environment:
bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a .env file with your Supabase credentials:
env
Copy
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-supabase-key
Run the Flask server:
bash
Copy
flask run
Set Up the Client:

Navigate to the client directory and install dependencies:
bash
Copy
cd client
npm install
npm start
Future Enhancements
Enhanced Client-Side Validation: Further validation on the client side can reduce invalid numeric input.
Pedigree Charting: Future versions may incorporate pedigree chart functionality.
Centralized Error Logging: Consider implementing a logging mechanism for easier debugging.

### Summary

- The **routes.py** file now includes clear docstrings and inline comments following Python best practices.  
- Helper functions are defined at the top for silent numeric parsing, ensuring that blank or invalid inputs are converted to `None` to prevent database errors.  
- The **README.md** is updated to document design decisions, setup instructions, and future enhancements.

These changes should help ensure no regression bugs occur in the future, and they provide clear documentation for any developers or AI models that work on the project.
