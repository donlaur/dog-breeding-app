# AI Development Notes

## Recent Feature Implementations

### Search Functionality

The search functionality was implemented with a focus on these key aspects:

1. **Backend Architecture**
   - Created a modular search endpoint at `/api/search`
   - Used PostgreSQL's `ilike` operator for fuzzy matching across multiple fields
   - Implemented entity-specific search functions to handle different data models
   - Added data enrichment to enhance search results with related information

2. **Frontend Integration**
   - Connected the search bar in the dashboard header to the search endpoint
   - Implemented a responsive search results page with entity filtering
   - Added empty states and loading indicators for improved UX
   - Used MUI components for consistent styling with the rest of the application

3. **Search Result Presentation**
   - Designed rich result cards with thumbnails and key information
   - Added categorization by entity type with count indicators
   - Implemented direct navigation to entity detail pages

### User Account Management

The user management system was built with these considerations:

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Separated user account management from breeder profile management
   - Created a dedicated user account page with tabbed interface
   - Implemented security features like password change with verification

2. **Notification System**
   - Added a notification center with read/unread states
   - Implemented filtering and bulk actions
   - Added notification settings for customization

3. **System Settings**
   - Created comprehensive settings for appearance, data, security, and advanced options
   - Implemented settings persistence with local state
   - Added visual feedback for setting changes

4. **Backend Support**
   - Extended auth endpoints for profile management
   - Implemented token-based authentication with a dedicated decorator
   - Added security measures like password verification

## Technical Approach

1. **Component Design**
   - Used MUI's component system for consistent styling
   - Implemented lazy loading for better performance
   - Created reusable components like TabPanel for the settings pages

2. **API Integration**
   - Extended the AuthContext with new profile management methods
   - Implemented proper error handling and loading states
   - Used RESTful patterns for all new endpoints

3. **Data Flow**
   - Used React state for local UI management
   - Leveraged context for application-wide state
   - Implemented proper loading and error states

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Added password verification for sensitive operations
   - Implemented token validation on protected routes
   - Sanitized user input before sending to the backend

## Future Development Opportunities

1. **Multi-User Support**
   - The account management system is now ready for role-based permissions
   - Different access levels could be implemented (admin, staff, customer)

2. **Enhanced Notification System**
   - Real-time notifications using WebSockets or SSE
   - Push notifications for mobile devices
   - Email integration for important alerts

3. **Additional Search Features**
   - Advanced filtering options
   - Saved searches functionality
   - Search history and suggestions

4. **Account Security Enhancements**
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Session management with device tracking
   - Account activity logging

## Lessons Learned

1. **State Management**
   - The context-based approach works well for the application's scale
   - Local component state is sufficient for UI-specific concerns

2. **API Design**
   - Modular API endpoints with clear responsibilities improve maintainability
   - Proper error handling is essential for a good user experience

3. **Component Organization**
   - Grouping related components in subdirectories improves code organization
   - Shared components should be easily reusable across the application
