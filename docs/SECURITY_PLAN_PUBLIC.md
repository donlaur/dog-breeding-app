# Dog Breeding App Security Implementation Plan

This document outlines our approach to implementing security best practices in the dog breeding application.

## Security Focus Areas

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implementing industry best practices for secure authentication
   - Utilizing secure storage mechanisms for credentials
   - Adding robust authorization controls
   - Standardizing token-based authentication across all API endpoints
   - Using the token_required decorator consistently throughout the application

2. **Input Handling**
   - Implementing comprehensive input validation
   - Adding data sanitization for user inputs
   - Following secure coding practices

3. **API Protection**
   - Adding security headers
   - Standardizing error handling
   - Implementing defensive measures

4. **Database Security**
   - Enhancing Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
   - Protecting sensitive data
   - Implementing principle of least privilege
   - Enforcing breeder_id constraints across all records
   - Ensuring proper data isolation between different breeding programs

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Securing environment variables
   - Implementing safe configuration loading
   - Protecting sensitive configuration data

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 weeks)
- Implement secure authentication practices
- Standardize token-based authentication across all non-public endpoints
- Review and enhance input validation
- Audit configuration management

### Phase 2: Enhancement (2-3 weeks)
- Add comprehensive security headers
- Improve error handling
- Standardize API response formats
- Implement proper token validation for production environment

### Phase 3: Advanced Security (3-4 weeks)
- Implement additional security measures
- Enhance Row-Level Security in database
- Conduct security testing
- Document security architecture

### Phase 4: Optimization (2-3 weeks)
- Improve CORS configuration with specific origins
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Enhance logging for security-related events
- Review and update breeder_id enforcement across all tables

## Security Best Practices

We are implementing the following security best practices:

- Using secure cookies with appropriate settings
- Implementing proper CORS configuration
- Adding content security policies
- Following OWASP security guidelines
- Regular dependency audits
- Secure database access patterns

## Ongoing Security Measures

- Regular security reviews
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Security-focused code reviews
- Documentation of security architecture
