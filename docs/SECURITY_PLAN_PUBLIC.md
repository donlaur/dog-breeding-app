# Dog Breeding App Security Implementation Plan

This document outlines our approach to implementing security best practices in the dog breeding application.

## Security Focus Areas

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implementing industry best practices for secure authentication
   - Utilizing secure storage mechanisms for credentials
   - Adding robust authorization controls

2. **Input Handling**
   - Implementing comprehensive input validation
   - Adding data sanitization for user inputs
   - Following secure coding practices

3. **API Protection**
   - Adding security headers
   - Standardizing error handling
   - Implementing defensive measures

4. **Database Security**
   - Enhancing Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
   - Protecting sensitive data
   - Implementing principle of least privilege

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Securing environment variables
   - Implementing safe configuration loading
   - Protecting sensitive configuration data

## Implementation Roadmap
