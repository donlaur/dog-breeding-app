# API Communication Pattern Standardization

## Problem Statement (March 14, 2025)

During the development of the CRM Lead Management feature branch, several merge conflicts were discovered that introduced inconsistent API communication patterns. These inconsistencies created potential regression bugs related to:

1. Inconsistent API response handling
2. Direct fetch calls instead of using the established utility functions
3. Missing error handling for API failure cases
4. Sending non-schema fields to the database causing server-side errors

## Changes Made

To resolve these issues, we systematically:

1. **Standardized API Communication**:
   - Refactored all API calls to use the `apiUtils.js` utility functions
   - Replaced direct fetch calls with `apiGet`, `apiPost`, `apiPut`, and `apiDelete`
   - Ensured consistent handling of response status and errors

2. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added comprehensive try-catch blocks for all API interactions
   - Utilized `debugLog` and `debugError` for consistent logging
   - Implemented user-facing error notifications via the notification system

3. **Added Data Sanitization**:
   - Explicitly removed non-schema fields before sending data to the server
   - Prevented common database errors related to fields added by the frontend
   - Added field-specific sanitization for components with complex data structures

4. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Enhanced the frontend architecture documentation with clear API patterns
   - Added code examples for proper API utility usage

## Technical Implementation

The standardization focused on several key files in the frontend codebase:

1. **MediaLibrary.js**:
   - Refactored to use `apiUtils` for API calls
   - Improved error handling
   - Added input sanitization logic

2. **ApplicationsList.js**:
   - Updated API calls to use `apiUtils`
   - Improved error handling
   - Added PropTypes validation

3. **DogForm.js**:
   - Ensured proper API utility usage
   - Added form data validation
   - Implemented data sanitization before API calls

4. **Heat Management Components**:
   - Standardized API patterns across AddHeat.js, EditHeat.js, and ManageHeats.js
   - Unified error handling approach
   - Added consistent data sanitization

## Benefits

These changes provide several key benefits:

1. **Consistency**: All components now follow the same API communication pattern
2. **Reliability**: Improved error handling reduces unhandled exceptions
3. **Maintainability**: Standardized patterns make code easier to understand and maintain
4. **Bug Prevention**: Data sanitization prevents common database errors
5. **User Experience**: Consistent error notifications provide better feedback

## Example Pattern Implementation

```javascript
// Import API utilities
import { apiGet, apiPost, apiPut, apiDelete } from '../../utils/apiUtils';
import { debugLog, debugError } from '../../config';
import { showSuccess, showError } from '../../utils/notifications';

// Example API call with proper error handling
const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    debugLog('Fetching data...');
    const response = await apiGet('/endpoint');
    
    debugLog('Data fetched:', response);
    setState(response);
    
    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    debugError('Error fetching data:', error);
    setError(`Failed to fetch data: ${error.message}`);
    showError(`Failed to fetch data: ${error.message}`);
    
    return null;
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};

// Example data sanitization and submission
const handleSubmit = async (formData) => {
  try {
    setSaving(true);
    setError(null);
    
    // Remove any non-schema fields
    const sanitizedData = { ...formData };
    delete sanitizedData.related_info;
    delete sanitizedData.display_name;
    
    const response = await apiPost('/endpoint', sanitizedData);
    
    debugLog('Submission response:', response);
    showSuccess('Data saved successfully!');
    
    navigate('/dashboard');
  } catch (error) {
    debugError('Error submitting data:', error);
    setError(`Failed to save: ${error.message}`);
    showError(`Failed to save: ${error.message}`);
  } finally {
    setSaving(false);
  }
};
```

## Future Recommendations

1. **Implement a Consistent Sanitization Function**:
   Create a centralized utility function that automatically removes known non-schema fields for each entity type.

2. **Type Safety**:
   Consider implementing TypeScript for better type safety and clearer API interfaces.

3. **Request/Response Validation**:
   Add schema validation on both client and server to catch data issues before they cause errors.

4. **Automated Testing**:
   Add integration tests to verify API communication patterns are followed.
